Brief Description of Goal of Code:
This app hopes to assess symptoms and other conditions of an individual to determine whether they have a cold or allergy.
 
Known Issues:
Results page isn't displaying the sentence in coordination with the results function. This was due to an issue with using the wrong variable for display; now has been corrected to proper function.
